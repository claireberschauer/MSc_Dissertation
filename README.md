# MSc_Dissertation
Contains my work while part of the SuperNEMO collaboration.

*MSc_Dissertation_Berschauer.pdf*: My complete dissertation!

## Code

*AnalyzeDrift_Class.py*: the module with the most up-to-date version of the AnalyzeDrift class, which automates radius calculation and contains many useful attributes for analysis like dead cell (and adjacent cell) identification. The .ipynb version of this should contain the same code, but I always update the python file first and use it myself (so this version definitely works). 

*Dissertation_Results_and_Analysis.ipynb*: Jupyter notebook with graphs and notes from my work on the drift model. This file has been updated since I submitted my dissertation, so it has the most up-to-date graphs and results. 

## Tech Support

*SuperNEMO on a Windows PC*: Document containing all the technical issues I encountered while working with SuperNEMO software on a Windows operating system and how I got around them. NOTE: This document is incomplete (05 Sept. 2023) but I'm working on it and intend to have a final version by Sept. 9th. 

## Artwork

I made some stickers and activity sheets for the July 2023 SuperNEMO Collaboration Meeting. The stickers are at the end of my dissertation, but all of the activity sheets are uploaded here. They have information on things to do in Edinburgh.
